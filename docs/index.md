# Interesting Facts

  - Radio travels faster in space than in a fiber.
  - Radio travels at the speed of light which is 3e8 m/s in a vacuum but light only travels about 68% as fast in glass.  Even radio in the dielectric coax cable is faster than fiber at 87% of the speed of light in a vacuum.
  - Radio travels at nearly the speed of light through the Earth's atmosphere since the air molecules are so spread out that the impact is negligible.
  - Once inter-satellite radio and optical communications are perfected, a data packet from the New York Stock Exchange to the London Stock Exchange will be faster over a LEO satellite network than the submarine fiber network.
